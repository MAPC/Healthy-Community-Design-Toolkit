# Placemaking

* **Placemaking** is a collaborative and creative process to help communities transform public spaces. [Learn more about Placemaking as a Safe & Active Streets strategy](../../transportation/make-safe-and-active-streets-the-goal/placemaking.md).&#x20;
* Research has found that placemaking activities improved either the functionality and/or aesthetic of a space, which in turn attracted more people to the area. Placemaking was found to increase the variety of activities in a location, including a shift from necessary to more recreational and social activities. `i`&#x20;
