# Community Plans

Community Plans set long-term goals and guide decision-making. Because these documents establish a vision for the future, they can be a very powerful tool in shaping the health of a community &#x20;

* There is strong evidence that access to natural settings in neighborhoods and during people’s daily routines improves and maintains mental health and wellbeing and can encourage increased physical activity. `i`
* There is growing evidence for the relationship between green and cultural spaces and the building of social networks. `ii`
* This relationship can be leveraged by fostering accessible parks, recreational programming, and public art that encourage bonding and bridging capital through community plans. &#x20;
* A **Comprehensive Plan** ([Learn more about Comprehensive Plans](../../housing-introduction/planning-and-assessment/community-plans.md)) can chart a path for a municipality’s development amidst changing social, economic and environmental conditions.&#x20;
  * Numerous elements impact social environment, key among them are the sections focuses on **open space and recreation** ([Learn more about Open Space and Recreation Plans](../../transportation/plan-for-active-transportation/community-plans.md)) and cultural resources. These sections provide an inventory of recreational and resources and open space and the significant natural, cultural and historic resources of a municipality. They represent the long-term vision for how these places and spaces are protected and managed.&#x20;
* There are a wide variety of additional plans that communities adopt, including **Greenway Plan, Bike** and/or **Pedestrian Plan**, that have implications for creating safe and active streets that encourage social interaction ([Learn more about Planning for Active Transportation](../../transportation/plan-for-active-transportation/))

Below are some best practices to consider:

* [ ] Focus efforts to develop new and improve existing recreational opportunities, parks, and greenways near underserved neighborhoods.&#x20;

* [ ] Apply ADA standards for accessible design to paths from park parking area or entrance to the edge of activity areas&#x20;
* [ ] Ensure activity areas include accessible paths and equipment for people with disabilities. &#x20;
* [ ] Plan an interconnected system of accessible open spaces. Ensure that open spaces are connected to multiple modes of transportation and are easily accessed by all residents.&#x20;
* [ ] Build and maintain sidewalk networks, and ensure that they connect to the larger community, including community open spaces. Include places for people to sit and rest.
