# Design Standards

* The **Road Design, Site Plan and Subdivision Standards**, and **Zoning** adopted by a municipality can have a significant effect on street safety and walkability. Using these mechanisms, municipalities can promote social interactions. &#x20;
* Making streets safer and more active (for example, by installing pedestrian crossings and refuges) can provide the opportunity for greater social interactions. Even if a walker feels like keeping to themselves, research shows that simply being out in public can contribute to a sense of community. `i`&#x20;
* Having places and a reason to interact is particularly important. For example, building a skate park provides opportunities for social connection among teens, while a bocce court might attract older adults.&#x20;
* Site design standards that encourage the creation of appealing meeting places, public parks, safe and pleasant public spaces, public seating, accessible and walkable spaces, and local shops can be used to promote social interactions, address access barriers, and strengthen community identity. `ii`
