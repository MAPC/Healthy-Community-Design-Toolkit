# Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design

**Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design** (CPTED) uses design of the built environment as a mechanism to reduce fear of crime and incidence of crime, with the goal of improving quality of life.

The four overlapping principles of CPTED are:&#x20;

* _Natural Surveillance_: Design can facilitate more “eyes on the street” and ensure more consistent  observation of public spaces, which can deter potential offenders&#x20;
* _Access Control_: Design can deter certain types of illegal activity&#x20;
* _Territorial Enforcement_: Policies and design elements can establish clear boundaries within and between public and private areas and strengthen feelings of ownership&#x20;
* _Maintenance and Management_: Policies and design elements can foster “pride of place”, attracted more wanted activities in public spaces&#x20;

For Mass in Motion Coordinators and other Massachusetts practitioners, MAPC has developed an online CPTED resource that should be a first stop for anyone interested in this mechanism. [Learn more on the MAPC Website](http://cpted.mapc.org).&#x20;
