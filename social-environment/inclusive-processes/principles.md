# Principles

* The following list of guiding principles originate from [_Community-Driven Climate Resilience Planning: A Framework_](https://www.nacrp.org), developed for climate resilience efforts across the country. However, these principles can provide some direction on how best to approach any equitable planning process.&#x20;
  * _Whole Systems Thinking_: All stakeholders have an important role to play. This approach draws upon local wisdom that communities have built, engages in cross-sector and cross-community strategy and learning, and develops collaborative solutions.  &#x20;
  * _Desired Outcomes Reflected at Every Step_: Planning processes are grounded in community assets and seek to demonstrate the impact of community-derived solutions. Equity and wellness are integrated in every step to ensure planning is consistently inclusive and causes no harm. &#x20;
  * _Planning Processes as Learning Processes_: Using popular education approaches, planning clearly communicates the causes and consequences of an issue to build the capacity of residents to participate and lead. Information flows both ways because residents are positioned as leaders to inform decision-makers. &#x20;
  * _Planning into Action_: Implementation is integrated early in the planning process by identifying and/or developing resources for implementation and organizing residents and other stakeholders. System changes are built into advocacy efforts.&#x20;
