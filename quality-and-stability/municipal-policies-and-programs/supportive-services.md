# Supportive Services

* Some conditions make it difficult for people to maintain a stable home without additional help. Supportive housing, a strategy that combines affordable housing with critical services, can facilitate access health-promoting resources and housing stability. 
* **Group homes** provide supportive housing to people with disabilities who cannot or choose not to live independently.  Massachusetts state law states that group homes should be permitted in every district \(cite\). 
* **Senior Housing** which includes continuing care communities, assisted  living facilities, nursing homes, and other retirement communities, serves a small percentage of Massachusetts’s older adults but meets an important need among the state’s diverse older population.  
* Zoning can, and often does, establish specialized use categories for various kind of senior housing. This enables communities to regulate where senior housing can go, and its basic lot characteristics  
* One challenge is that it often requires large parcels which are often only availableoutside of existing neighborhoods and far from existing commercial center. Theselocations can force residents into a car dependent lifestyle and/or isolate them from the broader community. 
* Communities can proactively identify appropriate parcels for senior housing andgroup homes work to steer development toward them. It is especially helpful ifcommunities can advocate for planned development that includes not only seniorhousing, but housing for other age groups as well and commercial development. 
* In Massachusetts, the Community Based Housing Program was established to give developers funds to create housing for people with disabilities. In accordance with the goals of this program, the housing needs to be integrated rather than segregated, accessible, and give people with disabilities maximum control of their housing choices Maximum universal design and visitability are criteria used to judge what projects receive funding.
