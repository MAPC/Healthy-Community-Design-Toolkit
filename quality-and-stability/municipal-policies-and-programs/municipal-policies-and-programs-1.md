# Municipal Policies and Programs

* Municipalities must lead by example, and local policies and programs can have significant effects on residential development and therefore community health. 
* Accessibility is one factor that makes finding adequate housing difficult for people with disabilities. Finding homes that are universally designed or adapted to the needs of people with disabilities may be difficult.  
* Universal Design incorporates the needs of everyone, including the older adults and people with disabilities, into a design to allow its use by the greatest number of people regardless of age or ability. Municipal policies can require universal design for municipal facilities like schools, senior centers, town halls and public spaces.  
* Another factor that makes finding housing difficult for people with disabilities is discrimination. 
* TK Fair Housing Policy 
* Taking into consideration the health of people who occupy buildings, Green Buildings address energy efficiency, indoor air quality, sunlight, stormwater management, urban heat island effects and other environmental issues to improve occupant health.  
* Fit buildings promote physical activity as part of the daily behavior of occupants. For example, a buildingâ€™s design can increase stair use by locating the stairs prominently by the entrance. 
* Municipal policy can require new development projects over 25,000 square feet to meet the requirements of the most current applicable USGBC \(United States Green Building Council\) LEED \(Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design\) and/or other applicable green building rating systems. A community could adoptgreen and fit buildings policies for school and municipal construction projects
