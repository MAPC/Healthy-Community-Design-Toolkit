# Inclusionary Zoning

**Inclusionary Zoning** mandates that housing projects above a certain size include a percentage of deed-restricted units affordable to low-, moderate-, or middle-income households.

Projects must be in a district that has been zoned for inclusionary housing. Inclusionary Zoning ensures that affordable housing is integrated into new market-rate developments, with minimal or no cost to municipalities. Inclusionary Zoning policies are usually accompanied by incentives for developers, such as increased density, parking waivers, lot and unit size waivers, or expedited permitting, so that the affordable housing does not result in undue financial burden for developers. Usually, the inclusionary units are deed-restricted in perpetuity to ensure long-term affordability
