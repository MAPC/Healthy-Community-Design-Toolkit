* A **Comprehensive Plan** can chart a path amidst changing social, economic and environmental conditions (e.g. increases in senior citizen populations with lower rates of automobile use), and can promote healthy housing strategies such as the production of a variety of housing types and sizes.
* A **Housing Production Plan (HPP)** is a five-year plan to meet existing and projected housing need and demand. HPP analyze housing need and demand in a community, considers housing development capacity and opportunities, examines the share of housing that is affordable, and establishes housing goals and strategies.
