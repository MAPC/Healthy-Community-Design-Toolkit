# Community Design and Health

There is a growing body of research that links community design to health outcomes. The benefits of clean air and clean water are well known, as are the benefits of physical activity, but there are a great many connections between community design and human health that are not as widely recognized. A walk in the park not only exercises the body, but also relaxes the mind,3 reduces brain fatigue,4 and increases the ability to maintain focus on specific tasks.5 Introducing greenery to urban areas has also been shown to clean the air we breathe,6 reduce and clean stormwater runoff \(keeping nearby water bodies cleaner\),7 and reduce elevated outdoor temperatures that occur in developed areas.8 Greener parts of inner cities have also been shown to feel safer and to have reduced crime \(provided that vegetation does not block views\).9
