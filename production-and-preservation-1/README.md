# Production & Preservation

* Mechanisms: Zoning, Subsidies 
* Zoning and financing tools can help communities produce and preserve diverse housing options that can enable people to remain within communities of our choice throughout the continuum of life.  
* When a communityâ€™s housing stock is primarily detached single family homes, residents may find it challenging to find a home that meets their needs.  
* The cost of housing \(rent or mortgage payments\), property taxes, and routine upkeep can result in high housing cost burdens, especially for those on a fixed income.  
* Single-family housing environments also provide poor access to services, social networks, and transportation for those without access to a vehicle.  
* However, across any housing type, lack of accessible features in the home can undermine the safety and mobility of frail older adults and people with disabilities.  
  * Zoning can be used to influence both WHAT housing gets built, WHERE that housing goes, and HOW it is designed.  
  *  Eliminate barriers to and increase funding for affordable housing
