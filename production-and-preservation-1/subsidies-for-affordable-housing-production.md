# Subsidies for affordable housing production

* Both homeowners and renters face housing cost challenges in a state where, in many regions, home values and rents have steadily increased to well above recession era levels. 
* A funding gap is the result of a difference between resources for a housing project and costs, when costs exceed resources. 
* At its most basic, affordable housing is difficult to produce because the lower rental income results in fewer resources available to finance a project. In affordable housing, this is often referred to as the ‘subsidy gap.’ 
* There are a variety of funding subsidies and operational subsidies that can support affordable housing production and preservation, detailed below. 

#### Funding Subsidies 

* **Development Cost Subsidies** that help reduce costs related to purchasing land, managing development processes \(e.g., permitting\), and construction ofhousing . Examples of these include grants and free or reduced cost land, building supplies, or labor. 
* **Tax Credit Subsidies** creates a source of equity funding to developers through income tax credit or tax benefit programs \(e.g. LIHTC, New Market, Tax Credits, Historic Preservation Tax Credits\) that can lower overall costs related to development and construction. 
* **Financing Subsidies** help increase the maximum supportable level of debt by offering financing with zero or lower interest. 

#### Operational Support and Subsidies 

* Operating Subsidies reduce operating expenses, such as utilities, thereby increasing net operating. 
* Rental Assistance Subsidies increase a project’s gross income, thereby increasing net operating income \(e.g. federal rental vouchers, MRVP\).
