# Placemaking

* **Placemaking** is a collaborative and creative process to help communities transform public spaces. A placemaking approach to mobility seeks out interventions to make streets and sidewalks feel like places to spend time in, rather than spaces simply to move through.&#x20;
  * These interventions can lead to improvements in traffic safety and accessibility as well as encourage a sense of community.
  * Placemaking projects are good pilots to test or make the case for policy changes in transportation and community design.

* Placemaking interventions can be permanent adjustments to the built environment to change how people move through spaces, interactive additions to encourage social activity or play, or temporary interventions.`i`&#x20;
* Some examples of placemaking include:&#x20;
  * sidewalk expansions, conversion of roadway into pedestrian space, and static pieces of public art&#x20;
  * exercise facilities, push-button heat lamps, and collaborative digital art&#x20;
  * events, performances and farmerâ€™s markets.&#x20;
