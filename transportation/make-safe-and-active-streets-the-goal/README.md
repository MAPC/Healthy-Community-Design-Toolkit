# Make Safe & Active Streets the Goal

**Mechanisms:** [**Policies and Programs**](./#policies-and-programs)**,** [**Safety Assessments**](safety-assessments.md)**,** [**Traffic Calming**](traffic-calming.md)**,** [**Placemaking**](placemaking.md)****

Research shows that street environments directly affect how much physical activity happens in a place. As vehicle speeds increase, injuries and deaths also rise. Communities can reduce the risk of crashes, injuries, and death and increase physical activity through implementing policies, programming, and quick-build construction projects.
