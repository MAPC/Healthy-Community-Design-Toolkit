# Universal Design

* **Universal Design** __incorporates accessibility – the ability to reach a destination or fully use a space – of everyone, regardless of a person’s age or ability, into a design. 
  * Municipal policies can require universal design for municipally-owned spaces, like schools, senior centers, town halls and public spaces.  
  * Although the main purpose of these guidelines is to provide good access for people with disabilities, designs that satisfy their requirements also meet the needs of many other people. Those who are travelling with small children or are carrying luggage or heavy shopping will all benefit from an accessible environment, as will people with temporary mobility problems \(e.g. with a broken leg\). 
  * The overall objective of inclusive design is to achieve social inclusion. `i`

Mass in Motion has partnered with the Department of Public Health’s Health and Disability Program to offer mini-grants to implement projects to make environments more accessible and inclusive. These projects use the **Community Health Inclusion Index** \(CHII\), a health community design tool. [Learn more about CHII](https://www.nchpad.org/1273/6359/Community~Health~Inclusion~Index/).

* The **Americans with Disability Act** mandates that state and local governments or public entities ensure that persons with disabilities can fully participate in all services, programs, and activities. 
  * The **Americans with Disability Act Transition Plan** is a formal document that outlines a community’s compliance with the ADA and provides a framework for continuous improvements and a roadmap for increasing access to all buildings, programs, services, roadways and sidewalks. 
  * Beyond ensuring that buildings meet physical accessibility standards, equity and inclusion for people with disabilities also means making people feel welcomed and ensuring that they are core members of the community as leaders.

_**Case Example: Snow and Ice Removal**_ Following a snowfall, snow and ice must be cleared from sidewalks, curb ramps and crosswalks promptly to provide safe and accessible passage for pedestrians. While the ADA specifies minimum clearances in their Guideline for Public Right of Ways, municipalities can provide additional details and action plans for achieving a clear zone after snowfall in their ordinances. 

The Federal Highway administration considers the following elements critical parts of an effective snow and ice removal program:

* timeframe for removal, 
* responsibility for removal, 
* ordinances, 
* compliance efforts, and 
* planning and outreach strategies `ii`
