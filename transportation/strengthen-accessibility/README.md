# Strengthen Accessibilty

_Mechanisms:_  ****[**Universal Design**](universal-design.md)**,**[ **Inclusive Mobility Programs**](inclusive-mobility-programs.md)\*\*\*\*

There are short term actions that cities and towns can take to retrofit or introduce environmental changes that increase active transportation and inclusion of residents, no matter age or ability.  These changes may include operational changes to existing equipment, physical alterations to roadway elements such as shoulders, sidewalks, crosswalks or curb ramps, and adjustments in policy language to adjust ongoing practices such as maintenance or prioritization of annual budgets. The importance of these changes is that they move conditions in the direction of active transportation and the ability to access not only work, but the various locations people need to visit for daily, social and health care needs.
