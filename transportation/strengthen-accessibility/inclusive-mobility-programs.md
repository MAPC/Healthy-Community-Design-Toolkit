# Inclusive Mobility Programs

Municipalities can devote staff resources to helping residents with disabilities, older adults, and others who do not have access to a car to travel to key destinations like jobs, medical appointments, and social and volunteer engagements â€“ thereby benefiting both personal wellbeing and the local economy.&#x20;

* Many Council on Aging and Senior Centers offer transportation programs themselves, coordinate volunteer drivers or subsidize taxi rides, and/or make a resources list of local transportation options for their community. MassMobility and MassDOT also provide support and resources to stakeholders across the state to address mobility barriers.&#x20;

_**Case Example: Travel Training.**_ Travel trainers help older adults, people with disabilities, and others gain the skills and knowledge they need to ride fixed-route public transit independently and safely. **** Travel trainers customize their training to the individual; some may only need a quick overview on how to pay the fare and how to signal for your bus stop, while others might need multiple sessions of riding alongside the travel trainer.&#x20;

Many transit authorities in Massachusetts offer **** travel instruction programs, as do some human service agencies and schools.&#x20;
