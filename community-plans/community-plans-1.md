# Community Plans

* Community Plans set long-term goals and guide decision- making. The most widely used plans impacting housing are Master Plans and Housing Production Plans.
* Because these documents establish a vision for the future, they can be a very powerful tool in shaping the health of a community.  
* A Master Plan can chart a path amidst changing social, economic andenvironmental conditions \(e.g. increases in senior citizen populations with lower rates of automobile use\), and can promote healthy housing strategies such asprotection or creation of TK.  
* A housing production plan \(HPP\) is a five-year plan to meet existing and projected housing need and demand, and to respond to residential developments seeking approval because a city or town has provided its fair share of affordable housing.HPP analyze housing need and demand in a community, considers housing development capacity and opportunities, and establishes housing goals and strategies. 
* Depending on their capacity, municipalities should consider working with a technical assistance provider or other project partner to develop a Master Plan orHPP. Communities should also provide opportunities for community engagement, have a clear action plan for implementing identified strategies, and build coalitions to advance implementation.
