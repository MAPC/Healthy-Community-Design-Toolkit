# Identifying Next Steps

### Partnerships

Ensuring that your communityâ€™s streets are a safe, active, accessible, and well-connected will require policy, systems and environmental change. Consider partnering with local, regional, and statewide groups with shared common goals. These could include:

* Regional Planning Agencies  
* Regional Transit Authorities 
* MassDOT District Staff 
* Regional Coordinating Councils 
* DCR
* Municipal officials and committee members \(Traffic, DPW, Engineering, Planning, Center on Aging, Disabilities Commission, Community Development\)
* Local Walk/Bike Advocates and Committees
* Local groups of older adults, people with disabilities, BIPOC, and others who may be interested in increasing mobility, active transportation, and/or street safety
