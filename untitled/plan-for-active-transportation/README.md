# Plan for Active Transportation

_Mechanisms:_ [**Community Plans**](community-plans.md)**,** [**Road and Site Design Standards**](road-and-site-design-standards.md)**,** [**Funding Active Transportation Infrastructure**](funding-active-transportation-infrastructure.md) 

The physical environment plays a powerful role in shaping the choices we make every day and can create impacts that we do not always perceive. Previous sections described ways to influence the physical environment through short actions and adjustments, yet long-term permanent changes for active transportation often require more comprehensive planning and policy efforts. 

> “The built environment presents both opportunities for and barriers to participation in physical activity, thereby influencing whether or not we exercise. Research by CDC and others has indicated that two of the main reasons for not exercising are lack of structures or facilities \(such as sidewalks and parks\) and fears about safety.”  **Richard Jackson**
