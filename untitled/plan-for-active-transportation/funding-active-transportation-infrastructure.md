# Funding Active Transportation Infrastructure

Municipalities can play a key role in providing funding and/or land for the development of bicycling and pedestrian facilities and supporting the ongoing maintenance and operation of transportation infrastructure.  

* **Capital Improvement Plans** \(CIP\) - The CIP addresses large scale infrastructure projects, such as road and school construction, and provides a local government a blueprint for projects for the next 5 to 10 years. By prioritizing those projects that promote walkability and bikeability, municipalities can ensure that there are adequate funds for sustainable transportation infrastructure projects and equipment.  
* **Sidewalk inventory and maintenance program** - in addition to spot repairs, some communities also employ sidewalk maintenance programs. Program cycle through a community over a number of years to systematically address all the locally owned sidewalks.

_**Case Example: Bringing Equity to Sidewalk Repairs using Boston Street Caster.**_ A Boston assessment of constituent requests for sidewalk repairs and sidewalk conditions found that only 1.1% of repairs were occurring in the most socially-vulnerable regions of the City. In response, Boston created StreetCaster, a asset and work order management system, to focus street repairs on the routes where people walk the most, in the most socially-vulnerable regions of the city.

* **Community Preservation Act** - Adopted at the municipal level, the CPA act raises money through a local property tax surcharge and state match that can only be used for open space preservation \(including greenways\), development of affordable housing, the acquisition and development of outdoor recreational facilities \(including playgrounds, bicycling, and pedestrian facilities\), and the preservation of historic resources. 

Grants can also play a role in providing resources for developing or improving biking, walking, and transit infrastructure. While the grant landscape changes over time, some grants that are particularly relevant to developing interconnected sustainable transportation networks are linked below:
