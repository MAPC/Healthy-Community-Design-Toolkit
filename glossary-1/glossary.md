| :--- | :--- |
| Infill Developments  | Infill Developments are projects in already developed areas that “fill in” vacant lots \(e.g. between existing buildings\). Infill most commonly happens in downtown areas and is designed to increase density to create a more walkable and more aesthetically uniform streetscape. Infill replicates historic city, town and village development patterns and is an important tool for concentrating development in walkable neighborhoods rather than sprawling into undeveloped areas. |
| Master Plans and Community Development Plans | Master Plans and Community Development Plans are community- wide, action-oriented plans designed to achieve a shared community vision. A Master Plan establishes future goals in areas such as land use, transportation, housing and economic development. |
| Universal Design | Universal Design incorporates the needs of everyone, including the older adults and people with disabilities, into a design to allow its use by the greatest number of people regardless of age or ability. |
| Smart Growth | Smart growth is development that protects natural resources, enhances quality of life, offers housing choices, reduces energy consumption, and improves municipal finances by considering the location, design, and longterm costs of development. Smart Growth is characterized by mixed-use downtowns and neighborhoods, diverse housing options and increased walkability. The Commonwealth includes smart growth in the State’s 10 Sustainable Development Principles. |
| Accessory Dwelling Apartments | Accessory Dwelling Apartments, sometimes called mother-in-law units, are smaller apartments located on single-family residential properties \(e.g. an apartment over a garage or in a converted garage\). Accessory Apartments can allow older residents to live near their family members or can offer low-cost housing options that provide supplementary income to homeowners.  When located near existing centers \(downtowns, village centers, etc.\), new accessory apartments provide walkable access to a variety of goods, services and recreational opportunities. |
| Compact Neighborhood Zoning \(CNZ\) | Compact Neighborhood Zoning \(CNZ\) is a new tool similar to 40R that features different residential density and affordability requirements. |
| Mixed-Use Zoning Districts  | Mixed-Use Zoning Districts allow more than one type of use on a single parcel. This typically refers to zoning that allows commercial uses on the first and sometimes second floors of a building, with the remaining floors above the commercial space zoned for residential uses. A mixed-use zoning district is not necessarily the same as a mixed-use district, which is a broader concept describing an area with a mix of complimentary commercial and residential uses where a variety of goods and services are available. Mixed-use districts can be zoned with a single Mixed- use zoning district, or may include a variety of different zoning districts. Mixed-use districts are also good candidates for form-based code. |
| Traditional Neighborhood Development \(TND\) | Traditional Neighborhood Development \(TND\) is characterized by homes on small lots with small setbacks. These developments, which can consist of both single family and multifamily homes, are modeled after older \(traditional\) neighborhoods near downtowns and village centers that have narrow streets, make use of on-street parking, and tend to have a more diverse mix of unit sizes and higher residential densities than newer neighborhoods. |
| Transit Orientated Development \(TOD\) | Transit Orientated Development \(TOD\) is a mix of uses clustered within walking distance \(usually ¼ mile\) of a transit station with a relatively high frequency of service. Successful TOD districts typically feature high quality pedestrian and bicycle networks, reduced parking requirements for automobiles, and public amenities in order to encourage compact multifamily homes and varied businesses. |
| Affordable Housing | Deed-restricted housing for low-or moderate-income households at a cost that does not exceed 30% of their monthly gross income. The median family income within a given metropolitan area as determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. AMI is used to determine household eligibility for most housing assistance programs |
|  Chapter 40B | M.GL. Ch. 40B, § 20-23, is a Massachusetts State law administered locally by the Board of Appeals in order to create affordable housing. In communities below the 10% statutory minimum, it provides eligible developers the ability to supersede local zoning if 20% to 25% of units are Affordable Housing. See Local Initiative Program for” Friendly 40B.”Project Eligibility \(PE\) determination, sometimes called Site Approval determines whether a project is eligible for 40B. Authority to make a PE determination lies exclusively with the agencies that administer housing subsidy programs: in most cases, MassHousing, MHP, Department of Housing and Community Development, or MassDevelopment \(Chapter 40B Handbook for Zoning Boards of Appeal, MHP\). |
| Chapter 40R | M.GL. Ch. 40R, § 1-14, provides for smart growth overlay districts with increased densities for residential development and multifamily housing by right \(subject to site plan review\). Chapter 40R Smart Growth Overlay District is a zoning district superimposed over existing underlying zoning districts that allows for higher density development. Within a 40R District, a developer has a choice of undertaking a higher density development in accordance with the requirements of the 40R Overlay District, or may undertake a lower density development in accordance with the requirements of the underlying district. Chapter 40R Districts feature increased residential densities, may allow for mixed-uses, and may establish design standards. 40R Districts must be located near transit stations or “areas of concentrated development” such as downtowns, and must meet specific state criteria regarding allowed housing densities and required percentage of affordable housing. Communities that establish a 40R District receive a one-time incentive payment from the state based on the number of additional \(“bonus”\) residential units permitted by-right \(beyond the number of units allowed by the underlying zoning districts\), and also receive bonus payments upon the issuance an occupancy permit for each “bonus” unit.  |
| Community Preservation Act \(CPA\) | M.GL. Ch. 44B, § 1-17, allows communities to establish a Community Preservation Fund for open space, historic preservation, and Affordable Housing by imposing a surcharge of up to 3% on local property tax bills. The State provides a partial match from the Community Preservation TrustFund, generated from Registry of Deeds fees. |
| Cost Burden | A household is considered cost burdened if more than 30% of monthly income is spent on housing costs. |
| Fair Housing Act | Established under Title VII of the 1968 Civil Rights Act, the federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings,and in other housing-related transactions, based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status \(including children under the age of 18 living with parents or legal custodians, pregnant women, and people securing custody of children underthe age of 18\), sexual orientation, gender |

| Inclusionary Zoning | A zoning ordinance or bylaw that encourages or requires developers to build Affordable Housing in their developments or provide a comparable public benefit, such as providing Affordable Housing in otherlocations \("offsite units"\) or paying fees in lieu of units to a Municipal Affordable Housing Trust Fund. |
| Missing Middle Housing | A range of smaller multi-unit or clustered housing types compatible in scale with single-family homes. These housing types tend to provide diverse housing options, such as duplexes, fourplexes, and townhomes, along a spectrum of affordability. |
| Mixed-Income Development | A residential development that includes market-rate and Affordable Housing. |
| Affordable Housing Trust \(AHT\) | Under M.G.L. Ch. 44, § 55C, an AHT is an entity created to provide for the creation and preservation of Affordable Housing in municipalities for the benefit of low-and moderate-income households. Any community can establish an AHT following adoption of M.G.L. Ch. 44, § 55C, by simple majority vote of the local legislative body. |
| Subsidized Housing Inventory \(SHI\) | A list of generally deed-restricted Affordable Housing units  |
| Subsidized Housing | Housing made affordable to low-or moderate-income people through public financial or other assistance |

Financing subsidies can be an opportunity for local large employers or anchor institutions \(health, education\) to step in and support affordable housing. |
| **Operating Subsidies** | Operating Subsidies reduce operating expenses, such as utilities, thereby increasing net operating. |
| **Rental Assistance Subsidies** | Rental Assistance Subsidies increase a project’s gross income, thereby increasing net operating income \(e.g. federal rental vouchers, MRVP\). |
