        <p><b>Chapter 40R Smart Growth Overlay District</b>
        </p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">is a zoning district superimposed over existing underlying zoning districts
        that allows for higher density development. Within a 40R District, a developer
        has a choice of undertaking a higher density development in accordance
        with the requirements of the 40R Overlay District, or may undertake a lower
        density development in accordance with the requirements of the underlying
        district. Chapter 40R Districts feature increased residential densities,
        may allow for mixed-uses, and may establish design standards. 40R Districts
        must be located near transit stations or &#x201C;areas of concentrated
        development&#x201D; such as downtowns, and must meet specific state criteria
        regarding allowed housing densities and required percentage of affordable
        housing. Communities that establish a 40R District receive a one-time incentive
        payment from the state based on the number of additional (&#x201C;bonus&#x201D;)
        residential units permitted by-right (beyond the number of units allowed
        by the underlying zoning districts), and also receive bonus payments upon
        the issuance an occupancy permit for each &#x201C;bonus&#x201D; unit. Compact
        Neighborhood Zoning (CNZ) is a new tool similar to 40R that features different
        residential density and affordability requirements.</td>

      <td style="text-align:left"><b>Form-Based Code</b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">is a relatively new type of zoning code that places an emphasis on building,
        site and community design over use regulations. In form-based codes, the
        physical form of the building (including height, setbacks and design standards)
        is established, while allowed uses are not as restricted as they are in
        standard zoning. Compared to traditional zoning codes, form- based codes
        set more specific requirements for the physical design characteristics
        of development, and are similar in some ways to a regulatory set of design
        standard. Form-based code can be combined with standard &#x201C;Euclidian&#x201D;
        or used-based zoning within several hybrid forms. Form-based codes are
        more illustrative than traditional zoning codes and are particularly appealing
        for use in special character districts (e.g. downtowns, historic districts
        and commercial corridors).</td>

        lots or adds units or uses in areas that are already developed. For example,
        a new infill building would be constructed in an empty lot between existing
        buildings. Infill most commonly occurs in and near downtown areas and is
        designed to increase density in order to create a more walkable, vibrant
        and aesthetically pleasing community. Infill replicates historic city,
        town and village development patterns and is an important tool for concentrating

        zoned for residential uses. A mixed-use zoning district is not necessarily
        the same as a mixed-use district, which is a broader concept describing
        an area with a mix of complimentary commercial and residential uses where
        a variety of goods and services are available. Mixed-use districts can
        be zoned with a single Mixed- use zoning district, or may include a variety
        of different zoning districts. Mixed-use districts are also good candidates

      <td style="text-align:left">also called Active Buildings, are buildings that promote physical activity
        as part of the daily behavior of occupants. For example, fit buildings
        can include designs that promote use of stairs over elevators.</td>

        These systems can range from thin soils with moss up to thick soils capable
        of supporting micro-farms. The main benefits of green roofs are enhanced
        stormwater management, insulating properties, and UV protection for roof

      <td style="text-align:left"><b>Urban Heat Island Effects</b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">occur when pavement and buildings absorb solar energy throughout the day
        and radiate that heat back into the air. This is due to pavement, buildings
        and other structures absorbing more heat from sunlight than the natural
        landscape. For example, this can cause the ambient temperature of a city
        of one million people to be 2-5&#xB0;F hotter during the day and up to
        22&#xB0;F hotter at night than a rural location in the same area.8</td>
