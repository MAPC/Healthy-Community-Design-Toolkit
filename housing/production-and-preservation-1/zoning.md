# Zoning

#### Provide communities with diverse housing options by: 

* Allowing for smaller lot sizes, mixed-use development and multifamily housing \(e.g. Accessory dwelling units, duplexes, rowhomes or larger multifamily developments\). 
* Make it easier to private and public sector to increase supply of housing to meet demand.  
* Address barriers like restrictive zoning to promote housing production of many types.

#### Traditional Neighborhood Development \(TND\) Zoning Overlay District 

* Establish a Traditional Neighborhood Development \(TND\) Zoning Overlay District to allow new neighborhood developments that are modeled after older neighborhoods characterized by walkability, a diverse mix of housing options, and higher residential densities.  

#### Mixed-use development  

* Mixed-Use Development is refers to when there is more than one type of use on a single parcel.  
* Zoning codes can be revised to encourage mixed-use development in downtown, village center and other appropriate locations. 
* Mixed-Use zoning typically allows commercial uses on the first and sometimes second floors of a building, with the remaining floors above the commercial space zoned for residential uses.  
* This is one of the crucial steps for redesigning communities in which older adults, people with disabilities, and others can make the healthy choice to bike, walk \(with or without a walker or cane\), use a wheelchair or use another mobility assistive device to get to basic goods and services \(cite\) 

#### Accessory dwelling units 

* Accessory dwelling units, sometimes called in-law apartments or granny-flats, are secondary dwelling unitsthat are added to an existing house. The accessorydwelling unit may be in a converted garage, or in anunderutilized wing of a house  
* When located near existing centers \(downtowns, village centers, etc.\), new accessory apartments provide walkable access to a variety of goods, services and recreational opportunities. Accessory units can also create low- cost housing options, provide supplementary income to homeowners, and provider better housing options for older adults or people with disabilities. \(cite\). 
* Many zoning codes do not allow accessory dwelling units.Others limit where they can be built by requiringexcessive large lot sizes or setbacks that do not fit thehistorical pattern of development in a community, or bypreventing the conversion of existing structures intoaccessory dwelling units.  

#### Sub-Division & Site Plan Review 

* Site Plan and Special Permit Review use established review criteria as the basis for requiring improvements to and approving development plans. 
* Subdivision Regulations establish the characteristics of roads and other features of new neighborhoods. 
* Communities can review site plan and subdivision regulations to ensure that senior housing will provide safeaccess and internal circulation for older adults and staff,and appropriate gathering spaces. 

#### Cluster Residential Developments  

* Also known as Open Space Residential Developments, these developments group residential properties on development site in order to preserve open space forhiking and other recreational opportunities.

In general, households in neighborhoods that have higher population densities, access to destinations, more grid-like street patterns, and access to high-quality bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure are positively associated with physical activity.iiiiv 

Making sure that destinations are accessible to all ensures that these health benefits are available to all residents  

#### TOD 

* Transit Orientated Development \(TOD\) is a mix of uses clustered within walking distance \(usually ¼ mile\) of a transit station with a relatively high frequency of service. Successful TOD districts typically feature high quality pedestrian and bicycle networks, reduced parking requirements for automobiles, and public amenities in order to encourage compact multifamily homes and varied businesses. 

#### Chapter 40R Smart Growth or Compact Neighborhood Zoning Overlay  

* Chapter 40R Smart Growth or Compact Neighborhood Zoning Overlay Districts are zoning tools to increase residential densities and allow mixed-use development near shopping and public transit.  
* Chapter 40R Smart Growth Overlay District is a zoning district superimposed over existing underlying zoning districts that allows for higher density development 
* 40R Districts must be located near transit stations or “areas of concentrated development” such as downtowns and must meet specific state criteria regarding allowed housing densities and required percentage of affordable housing.  
* Communities that establish a 40R District receive a one-time incentive payment from the state based on the number of additional \(“bonus”\) residential units permitted by-right \(beyond the number of units allowed by the underlying zoning districts\), and also receive bonus payments upon the issuance an occupancy permit for each “bonus” unit.  
* **Compact Neighborhood Zoning \(CNZ\)** is a new toolsimilar to 40R that features different residential density and affordability requirements.

{% tab title="HOW" %}
Visitability 

* The Americans with Disabilities Act established standards for physical accessibility of buildings and spaces that must be met by most public and commercial entities \(especially new construction\). Communities should complete their ADA transition plan to ensure these standards are being met. 
* However, there is no similar requirement that covers private housing. Visitability, a relatively new movement that advocates for a small number of design modifications to all homes to enable a minimum level of access by almost all people, can incentivized through local zoning provisions.  
* Visitability modifications include:  
  * At least one zero-step entrance \(meaning the front door is level with the ground outside  
  * Doors and halls with at least 32 inches of clear passable width  
  * A ground floor half-bathroom that is accessible by wheel chair  
* Planning Boards can provide density bonuses for developments that provide visitable housing. 

#### Parking Requirements 

* Reduce off-street parking requirements in order to allow more space in central locations to be utilized for housing, retail and other active uses \(increasing development densities\). This has the co-benefit of reducing the negative impacts associated with an oversupply of off-street parking \(aesthetic impacts, dead spaces in central commercial areas, sprawl and increased driving impacts, reduced walkability, increased stormwater pollution, etc.\).\(cite\) 
* Reduce off-street parking requirements or allowing the Planning Board to reduce off-street parking requirements when reduced needs are demonstrated through shared parking arrangements, mixed-uses with different peak parking times, demand management measures, etc. can reduce the costs of building, making housing development more feasible.
