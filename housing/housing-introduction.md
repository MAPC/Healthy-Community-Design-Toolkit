# Housing Introduction

Stable, quality housing is an essential component of good health. When individuals live in a safe, affordable home and community, they can prioritize their health, better manage disease, and invest in their well-being. High housing costs can force individuals to choose between housing payments and other essentials such as food, medical care, and utilities. It can also contribute to increased stress, which decreases resistance to disease.`i` Children in unstable housing are at risk of malnutrition and developmental delays that can have lifelong health consequences.`ii` Housing that is not adequately maintained, ventilated, or free from pests and contaminants, such as mold, lead, and radon, contributes to rates of injury, asthma, cancer, neurotoxicity, cardiovascular disease, depression, and poor mental health.

There is much that you can do to address housing challenges. It can be difficult to know where to start and how to structure an effective local housing strategy.

So what steps can you take to steer your community toward housing that supports more equitable health outcomes and protects the health of all residents, including older adults and people with disabilities?

To help you figure out where to begin, we have categorized the many local housing policies into three functional areas: Planning & Assessment, Production & Preservation, and Quality & Stability.

For each area, we list possible mechanisms for influencing local housing strategy.
