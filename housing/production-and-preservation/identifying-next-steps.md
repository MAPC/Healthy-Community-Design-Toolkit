Identify and seek to remove barriers, e.g., onerous special permit conditions, within permitting process related to housing development in locations within walking distance of parks, healthy food options, retail, services, and employment.

Establish a pre-site plan and subdivision design review process that creates an Inter-Departmental Project Review, including representatives from various municipal departments/boards, including the Board of Health, to provide review and feedback on projects for healthy design strategies while still in design development.
