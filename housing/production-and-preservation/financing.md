# Financing Affordable and Supportive Housing

A funding gap is the result of a difference between resources for a housing project and costs, when costs exceed resources.

At its most basic, affordable housing is difficult to produce because the lower rental income results in fewer resources available to finance a project. In affordable housing, this is often referred to as the subsidy gap.

* There are a variety of funding subsidies and operational subsidies that can support affordable housing production and preservation. **Development Cost, Tax Credit**, and **Financing Subsidies** are the most common funding subsidies used to reduce the overall costs of developing and constructing housing. **Operational Subsidies** reduce expenses, such as utilities, or increase a project’s income, such as rent subsidies, to increase a residential building’s operating income.

Municipalities can play a role in filling the subsidy gap through providing funding and/or land for affordable housing. Key examples of this include **donating land**, establishing a **Housing Trust Fund**, or adopting the **Community Preservation Act**. 

* **Community Preservation Act** - Adopted at the municipal level to create a local fund for affordable housing development and preservation activities \(as well as open space and historic preservation activities\) through a local property tax surcharge and state match. 
* **Donating Land** - To provide critical public benefits, such as affordable housing, municipalities can sell, rent, or exchange public-owned property to a private entity. The intent of this strategy is not to sell sites to the highest bidder, but use public property as an opportunity to deliver a public benefit that may be difficult to otherwise obtain. 
* **Affordable Housing Trust** – funds established by municipalities that collect funds from dedicated sources for local initiatives to create and preserve affordable housing.
