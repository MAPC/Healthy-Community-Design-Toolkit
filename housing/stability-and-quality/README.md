**Mechanisms:** [Municipal Policies and Programs](municipal-policies-and-programs.md), [Integration of Supportive Services](integration-of-supportive-services.md), [Ensuring Housing Quality ](ensuring-housing-quality.md)

Observational studies have shown that being without a stable home is detrimental to oneâ€™s health. Housing instability can result in disruptions to employment, social networks, education, and the receipt of social service benefits. It is a barrier to proper medication adherence and has been associated with increased risk of teen pregnancy, substance abuse, and depression. `i`

Housing that is not clean, safe, adequately maintained, ventilated, or free from pests and contaminants, is an important contributor to rates of injury, asthma symptoms, cancer, neurotoxicity, cardiovascular disease, depression, and poor mental health. Lack of universal design may lead to further injury amongst those with mobility restrictions and be a barrier to safely aging in place. While many people have difficulty securing safe, decent, and stable housing, disabled people and older adults may face additional barriers.
