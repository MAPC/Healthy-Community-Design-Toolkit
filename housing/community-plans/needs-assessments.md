# Needs Assessments

Health needs assessments identify key health needs and issues through systematic, comprehensive data collection and analysis 

Healthcare systems and public health departments produce **community health needs assessment \(CHNA\)** for the residents living within their service area. In Massachusetts, CHNAs are recommended to focus on the community’s physical, social and economic environments to encourage healthy behaviors and improve health. Housing is intertwined with the built, social, and economic environments of neighborhoods and is a current health priority of the Massachusetts Department of Health \(https://www.mass.gov/doc/health-priority-0/download\) 

* Hospitals must conduct a CHNA and propose community health improvement strategies every three years. These assessment and planning processes often include community partners and are intended to guide healthcare system funding decisions.  
* Age Friendly Needs Assessment are a specific type of needs assessment, focused on the promotion healthy aging and the delivery of elder services. 
* The “active aging” framework looks at the determinants of active aging \(e.g., social, economic, behavioral, personal, etc.\) along with other age-friendly aspects of communities \(e.g. transportation, housing, social participants, outdoor spaces, etc.\)
